			<!-- CSS Icon iFrame -->
			<iframe src="https://cssicon.space/#/icon/check" title="w3 Schools CSS Homepage"></iframe>

			<p>The above website created by Wenting Zhang, is a refernce tool for creating shapes with pure CSS. The tool features numerous shapes and icons already created in CSS, which you can copy and paste code to your own project to use. The second part to the tool allows you to make quick animations between icons, and also supplies the corresponding code for your usage. The webpage, along with her talk at the coding event dotCSS, were extremely helpful in understanding the box model CSS uses and how border radii can be manipulated to create numerous different shapes.</p>

			<!-- Colour picker iFrame -->
			<iframe src="https://imagecolorpicker.com/en" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

			<p>The above website is exactly as described, a colour picker. The website gives you an eyedroper that you can use to find the hex codes and rgba values for specific colours. The tool gives you the option to upload pictures/files from your computer to select from, or to input a web address and it takes a screenshot for you which can then be used for colour selection. This tool has been extremely handy in matching color palettes and I used it extensively in exercise 2, the CSS Flags exercise.</p>
			
			<!-- Clippy iFrame -->
			<iframe src="https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

			<p>The above tool is one I have not yet used, but see value in keeping it in my toolkit of resources. Clippy, created by Bennett Feely allows you to make and edit clipping masks of any shape which are translated into code so that you can easily copy and paste to achieve your desired shape. This is another webpage that I found through suggested resources provided in the course outline.</p>

			<!-- Indirect flights iFrame -->
			<iframe src="https://indirect.flights/" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

			<p>The above is inspiration for ACT II: Interactive Media, created by Joe Hamilton. I like the abstractness and the imagery created through his interactive use of collage. </p>

			<!-- Recursor iFrame -->
			<iframe src="https://pointerpointer.com/" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

			<p>The above is inspiration for ACT II: Interactive Media. I like the randomness of the images and the accuracy of their coding as to locating where the mouse currently is on the screen to be able to provide an image of a person(s) who are pointing in the same direction.</p>
