		<h1>Exercise 1: Self-Portrait</h1>

		<p>Assignment parameters: Find an online tool to create a self-portrait. Make sure to share your self-portrait to the Icebreaker discussion with a little description (300 words), and include a link to the tool you used to create your portrait. 
			<br>
		Assignment Objective: This is intended to be an icebreaker to help you introduce yourself to the class. In addition, this will get you started with collecting tools and experiments on the web that you can use as inspiration and reference for future projects. Some questions to consider when creating your self-portrait:
		<ul>
			<li>Who you are?</li>
			<li>Where youâ€™re from?</li>
			<li>What you like?</li>
			<li>What you make?</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Hello Everyone, <br>
		
		To refresh incase anyone didn't hear me in class, my name is Joseph Caiado, but most people just call me Joey. I use he/they pronouns for the most part but am also open to just about any pronouns you could use! This is my fifth year, but first summer, at ocadu studying in the digital painting and expanded animation program (DPXA). <br>

		Relating to my studies in animation, the online tool I chose to make a self-portrait with is Michael Bromley's demo website of his code titled, Chromata. Chromata is a JavaScript code that Bromley created which renders a file in real time through a series of code which populates a series of lines that independently trace their own path through the image through reading color data of the pixels of the selected image. I found the premise of this code and the animation intriguing, so naturally I dropped in a photograph I had taken of myself that I am very particular to. The animation created (and the image I'm posting) reflects how we as humans, are ever growing and changing beings, in perpetual movement from birth, and well past our death. I particularly relate to this as a queer individual, I feel like I have and continue to go through a lot of extra growth internally that cis/heteronormative individuals do not have to attempt. I am constantly learning new things about myself and this perpetual growth I feel is beautifully reflected in the animations Bromley's coding tool creates. I would highly recommend uploading an image and trying it out for yourselves! <br>
