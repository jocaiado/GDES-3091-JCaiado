				<h3>Q1: What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</h3>
				<p>In the reading Lialina shares opinions from both sides discussing how the language of ‘user’ affects the ways in which technology is interacted with. Her opinion on this language becomes clear when she states that, “the denial of the word “user” in favor of “people” becomes dangerous. Being a User is the last reminder that there is, whether visible or not, a computer, a programmed system you use” (Lialina, 2012). Lialina further articulates her thinking by highlighting the difference between developer and user, and how the roles specify different permissions regarding how technology is used. Also, as important to this conversation of developers and users that Lialina doesn’t address is the difference in intentions. While developers desire to rid themselves of the language of the user, their aim for technology is to envelope the user in the experience and make it apart of the human experience. I think this also brings up issues of general technology versus personalized, specific technology and how our society has entered a state in which all technology attempts to pull data from users, and then use the captured data in various ways. The intentions again here are an important differentiator, where this technology is specifically aimed at selling data and thus selling more products to consumers, taking advantage of background software analyzing and capturing user data. In contrast, Lialina highlights how users are not thinking about the specifics of the technology, but rather the way that it can aid them in completing certain tasks.</p>

				<h3>Q2: What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h3>
				<p>Lialina’s ideal internet user is the Universal or Turing Complete User. The universal user is formed though decades of users adjusting general purpose technology to personal needs. She describes how these users use existing software and applications in the way developers intended them to be used. But she also highlights how these users find their own ways to use software that suits their specific desires and/or needs. These users can accomplish goals with software regardless of the intended purpose prescribed by developers. Lialina continues to explain how these users have a particular relation to technology in which they are outside the developer construction of the ‘busy user’. Finally, and possibly most importantly, these users are self-aware of their interactions with technology. She gives examples of ways this user interacts with technology,</p>

				<p style="margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 1.5em; margin-top: -0.5em;">“General Purpose Users can write an article in their e-mail client, layout their business card in Excel and shave in front of a web cam. They can also find a way to publish photos online without flickr, tweet without twitter, like without facebook, make a black frame around pictures without instagram, remove a black frame from an Instagram picture and even wake up at 7:00 without a ‘wake up at 7:00’ app” (Lialina, 2012).</p>

				<h3>Q3: From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h3>
				<p>I think that most software and developers are extremely dependent on feedback and comments from users, as they cannot know how their technology will be received. Users are the ones interacting with software and technology in ways that developers do not anticipate, and thus find gaps that leave space for the universal user. <br>

				The only experiences I can think of interacting on the web in which gaps exist are on user made sites. The example that comes to mind is Sunday sites, in which most of the user made websites have ways they encourage you to interact with them, but still have room for interaction in your own ways. <br>

				In our current state of technology, I believe that most gaps in user interactions with software are taken advantage of by developers. Either to implement new ways of interacting with software, or to create new entities—we see this in apps like Snapchat and Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. All created with one specific intention, to solve a gap in software services that users had previously addressed themselves in their own unique ways. Now all these services do about the same thing, but each person uses each in their own specific ways.</p>
