				<h1>Reading 5: Poetry of Tools</h1>
				<p>by: Mindy Seu</p>

				<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</li>
					<li>Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Please respond to each question with a <i>minimum</i> of 150-word answer.</p>


				<h3>Q1: In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h3>
				<p>From the reading, my understanding of Seu’s concept of ‘defamiliarizing our tools,’ is a way to consider our interactions with technology outside of the daily, mindless and often automated gestures we have when interacting with technology. The clicks, the taps, the swiping. She highlights how new technologies are continually being introduced and old ones are improved upon—but the way we interact with these technologies remains unchanged. Defamiliarizing our tools is a concept rooted in engaging with and utilizing technology beyond their novel and/or intended uses. With this concept, Seu encourages readers and gadget users to use the tools we have as a point of contention. <br>

				I think that this action of attempting to view and utilize technology outside of the provided contexts or method relates to the emotional and personal aspects of poetry itself. Seu could have connected these concepts using another form of literature, but the specific choice to reference poetry suggests she wants to provide an open-endedness that allows for a multitude of understandings. Had she chosen to refer to it as the essay of tools, or the report of tools, it articulates an academicism that is not as present with the use of the word poetry.</p>

				<h3>Q2: Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h3>
				<p>Removing function from form, Seu describes as working directly with the form of interfaces. This involves the separation of the tool from it’s proposed or prescribed purpose and a re-imagining the outward or user-facing elements of an interface. <br>

				The website/interface I chose which operates within her definition of removing function from form is Matthew Rayfield’s Pop-up Trombone. Pop-up Trombone is an interactive website that allows the user to (virtually) play the trombone. The website first loads into a home screen from which the user is then able to interact with Rayfield’s other work or jump into the trombone. The interface opens another window resized to the image of a trombone which can be dragged and resized to make the corresponding sounds of trombone notes. The website is exclusively to be used as a virtual trombone of sorts and works outside of the expected experiences seen within every day scrolling. As Seu mentions in the introduction to her article, these everyday, mindless, and expected interactions are the clicks, taps, typing, and swiping, and Rayfield immediately steps outside these expectations within using the resizing of the browser as his focus for the interaction. Utilizing the resizable nature of the interface, Rayfield creates an experience that both highlights features of the browser in a unique way, and also allows for a multiplicity of experiences for users.</p>
