				<h3>Q1: What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</h3>
				<p>Mitch Goldstein’s article proposes that the main challenges people face when giving a critique consist of being kind as opposed to nice, avoiding corrective critiquing of work and lastly, feeling stuck about how to provide colleagues with constructive feedback or readings of the work presented. Expanding these points further, he explains the difference between nice and kind critiques. He understands a nice critique as one that doesn’t dive deep enough into the work to give generative feedback as the critic is over-considerate of the artist’s personal emotions and feelings. Goldstein gives valuable knowledge when he explains, “critique serves the work, not the person who made the work” (Goldstein, 2022). Regarding corrective critique, he explains how this can be a good entry point into giving critique but not in the longer term. This in part is due to the way corrective critique gives the artist a feeling of correctness in pursuing a particular process of artmaking which is not natural or suited to the artist and can leave them dependent on this particular type of feedback for next steps in their project’s development. In the last section Goldstein addresses how to give valuable information to the artist when you are feeling stuck, that can still be constructive in the artist’s next steps. His suggestions are to say what you see, and how the work makes you feel, which can help the artist understand if their work is conveying the message they have intended it to.</p>

				<h3>Q2: How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</h3>
				<p>For this question I think the quote I pulled in my response to my question is just as valid in this situation. To reiterate, Goldstein says in his article, “critique serves the work, not the person who made the work” (Goldstein, 2022). Peers and colleagues are critiquing your work in an effort to improve the work and are not commenting on your skills as a creative or how they feel about you. He also emphasizes the importance of recognizing critiques as a form of generative brainstorming for heightening the effectiveness of your work. For example, brainstorming is a generative process we are taught to use for any type of thinking/ideating/creating when we don’t have a place to start. But this brainstorming process is used mostly as a leaping-off point. We are not bound to use any and all ideas we come up within the process, but it is rather a tool for recognizing and acknowledging the variety of ways we can think about or approach a project. Critique is very similar in this regard. We needn’t accept every single critique as ways we have to or should approach a project, but rather a brainstorming of ideas and articulations that can help us improve upon an existing idea. Further highlighting how even critiques you don’t agree with, can be a source of inspiration or challenge to improve upon and create work you are confident in.</p>

				<h3>Q3: Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?</h3>
				<p>I think Goldstein explained this best in his article when he said, “everyone is there to learn and grow and often you can learn as much from giving a crit as you can from getting one” (Goldstein, 2022). And in a sense, this question feels more of overarching question of the importance of collaboration in artmaking practices. <br>

				We each are individual. Individuals with our own viewpoints, our own feelings and emotions, our own understandings of the world around us; and this influences how we make art. There is only so much we can refine a concept or artwork inside the parameters of our experiences and understandings of the world as an individual. Much like an echo chamber, we end up stuck inside specific ways of articulating our thoughts and ideas. This is where outside input and feedback becomes extremely valuable. This plays into the interrelations between creatives. Critique on work is valuable feedback and this often means all creatives are seeking response to the work they are/have created. Further explaining how the knowledge of critiquing but also receiving critique play an important role in relations between artists.</p>
