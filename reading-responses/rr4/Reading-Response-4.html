				<h3>Q1: Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h3>
				<p>Schwulst advocates for personal websites over social media for many reasons. First and foremost, she highlights that social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest are owned by big corporations that have their own priorities and goals. Being privately owned companies and having their own servers, these companies create their own policies and guidelines as to how users are allowed to act and interact with the service and others on the platform. Overall, her main point of contention is the lack of control users have over their digital presence and the way that opinions can be skewed due to this lack of control. The issue I have with social media and websites owned by big corporations is the way self-implemented policies negatively affect certain groups of users moreso than others. Through my time on social media, I’ve seen the extreme policing of specific content that goes on directly from these corporation’s policies. From queer art and resources to black joy, the aimless censorship of content created by and for minority groups sends a clear message. You’re not welcome here. <br>

				This is where having small, individual websites to be able to create and share content with those around you comes into consideration. On your webpage, you can customize every single part of the page to your liking and post the content you want to post. Why? Because it is yours.</p>

				<h3>Q2: In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behavior of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison.</h3>
				<p>Website as Canvas. <br><br>

				A webpage, like a canvas, starts out as a blank slate for you to create on, around, outside, and above. Built on your ideas and concepts, coding is your method of creation. Defining and redefining values to create the aesthetic you so desire. <br>

				Much like a painting, web designing requires you to have the right tools to accomplish what you want to create. Instead of a physical object such as a paintbrush, the tools for web design are your knowledge of coding languages and your ability to find the knowledge that you may be lacking in. They both allow you as the artist/architect to develop a piece that is authentically yourself, without interference from outside influence. That said, maybe outside influence has inspired you and is the source of your motivation to create. You could create a basic functional site in a couple of hours, or you could spend months and even years in a continual process of refinement. Much like a painter does in the studio. Once finished, paintings are often hung in galleries and on walls to be admired similar to how a website is published and then accessible by other users on the internet.</p>
