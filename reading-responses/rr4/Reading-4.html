		<p class="sub-text">an informal webpage by Joseph Caiado</p>

		<p>A webpage, like a canvas, starts out as a blank slate for you to create on, around, outside, and above. Built on your ideas and concepts, coding is your method of creation. Defining and redefining values to create the aesthetic you so desire. <br> <br>

		Much like a painting, web designing requires you to have the right tools to accomplish what you want to create. Instead of a physical object such as a paintbrush, the tools for web design are your knowledge of coding languages and your ability to find the knowledge that you may be lacking in. They both allow you as the artist/architect to develop a piece that is authentically yourself, without interference from outside influence. That said, maybe outside influence has inspired you and is the source of your motivation to create. You could create a basic functional site in a couple of hours, or you could spend months and even years in a continual process of refinement. Much like a painter does in the studio. Once finished, paintings are often hung in galleries and on walls to be admired similar to how a website is published and then accessible by other users on the internet.
