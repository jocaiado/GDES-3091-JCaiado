				<h3>Q1: Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</h3>
				<p>The ideological camps of flat and skeuo for web design I would say are comparable to the camps of 2D and 3D prominently seen in animation. This divide between ideological camps of realism and abstraction is seen fundamentally between creatives at large and is based in differing aesthetic biases. I think that to say one ideology is better than another is to be foolishly biased. I don’t think that styles of art can be related in a conversation of which one is better, as this would imply that some styles of art are inherently bad—which I don’t believe to be an objective understanding but rather personal bias. <br>

				To respond based on my own opinions I think that skeuo alone, alike photorealism, gives a flat, unified perception to how imagery is understood. As this style of art is based in the recreation of experienced imagery, I believe much of the interpretation is in the recognition of the things that are recreated rather than requiring an individual to read into the imagery. All styles and techniques for creating art and/or design require ample practice and skill, and thus they are equal in this regard. But where I see a difference in application is the ways in which styles ask the audience to understand them. Skeuo asks only that the audience recognize what the image displays, while flat requires a more thorough reading of the entire image to create this same recognition of imagery. I believe the goal would be to be in-between the two camps, as they quite ironically exist on a scale. For example, I think that the work of Salvador Dali uses enough aspects of realism to get you to recognise things, but then distorts your understanding of these things through his use of abstraction. <br>

				I think in terms of what ‘screens want,’ I agree with Frank Chimero in that “screens are aesthetically neutral, […] the look of things are not a part of their grain” (Chimero, 2013). I think it's important to recognize that screens are created with the expectation that they will be interacted with and through, and thus I would suggest that more likely they desire interaction. We interact with screens through the pixels they contain, which are continuously manipulated and rearticulated through various forms of interaction. As well, the argument that screens are flat and thus desire to create flat imagery is not reflected amongst other artistic practices. We as humans have created 3-dimensional works on flat surfaces (canvases, paper, even cave walls) for the entirety of our existence.</p>

				<h3>Q2: What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h3>
				<p>The zoopraxiscope is a piece of filmmaking technology invented in the 19th century by Eadweard Muybridge. Muybridge’s intention for the device was to experiment if he could take a series of photographs and re-animate them and thus recreate the movement of the horse. To create the device, he printed his photographs on a glass disk in sequential order, lit them from underneath which created a projection of the images and then caught those projections on a screen. To make the zoopraxiscope work, the light was turned on and the disk was spun at a high speed, which successfully recreated the motion of Muybridge’s horse. The device he created to view the playback of his animation is considered one of the origins of screens, making it an important piece of web design history. His invention was also important to the interactivity of web design as recreating motion, and the ability to manage time and change are key to creating interaction with users. <br>

				Another example of filmmaking that inspired digital design is Charles-Emile Reynaud’s praxinoscope. Like Muybridge’s zoopraxiscope, the praxinoscope was a device used to create animation through a sequence of images. What differed between the devices was their size, and their methods of capturing the moving image. Reynaud’s device used a strip of pictures placed around the inner circle of a cylinder, which was then spun, and the moving images were caught in the reflection of a mirror placed centrally to the device. The device was also small enough to be held in the hand of the viewer, implying an individual usage and viewing compared to the zoopraxiscope's screen, which could be viewed by several people at the same time.</p>

				<h3>Q3: Do you agree that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</h3>
				<p>I believe that as Chimero explained earlier in the article and the quote I introduced in my response to the first question, “screens are aesthetically neutral” (Chimero). I don’t agree that screens ‘want’ anything outside of the purpose for which they are sold, and that is interaction. Here’s why. There’s a major difference between what the technology wants and what the user interacting with the technology wants. Addressing the question based on the presumption that technology, including screens, do not have sentience, screens are a blank canvas for us to create what we desire out of them. Following this train of thought, screens do not have a bias or preference towards the aesthetics they display, rather the people who use them have a preference in the aesthetics they display. If we use Chimero’s definition of flux, which is the capacity for change, the question reads, “do you agree that screens want the capacity to change” and this is something inherent to their design. I’d agree with the statement given it was changed to align more with the statement, ‘users want flux’ or going the opposite direction, ‘screens have flux’.</p>
