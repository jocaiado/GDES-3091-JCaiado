				<h1>Index Process</h1>

	            <h2>1. Research and Sitemapping</h2>
	            <p>Before attemping to code anything, I wanted to have a design that I found aesthetically pleasing and easily navigatable in mind. Firstly, I scoured the internet to find inspiration for the page design. The theme or Concept we were given to work with for the project is 'index: a collection of works'. This concept made me think about archives, and the way in which we store and keep track of data. With this in mind, I had a few ideas that could play on this idea of the archive and personal archiving. <br>

	            My first idea was the Stamp cards that used to be used in Libraries to keep track of who borrowed materials and the corresponding dates of when they had the materials and when they were to be returned. I imagined this layout as a single page, containing the links to all relevant exercises, reading responses, projects and resources. This page, to be the main page, would use the styling of the stamp card but using the names of projects (instead of a borrower's name) and their corresponding due dates. Each page within would be styled like a page in a book, with margins on both sides and page numbers. This style is shown in the second and third images. <br>

	            My second idea, and the one that decided to move forwards with works in a similar vain. Instead of focusing on a stamp card as the user interface, I wanted to create the UI in a way that replicated a textbook with sticky notes in it. This idea not only reflects the idea of indexicality, but also being in an academic institution and the practices many of us utilize to track important information. In this idea, each type of assignment is one sticky note, and then the subsequent projects fall underneath an over-arching umbrella. This will create an interation when the user hovers over a tab to expand and show all the important assignments or figuratively, points of interest within the larger text. Each page like my first idea, is styled as a page in a book with margins on both sides and a page number. This design would require more work creating a navigation bar to explore the works, whereas the first one I did not have a way to navigate from one page to another without going back.</p>

	                <img src="index-process-images/IMG_0998.JPG" width="30%">
	                <img src="index-process-images/IMG_1002.PNG" width="30%">
	            </figure>

	            <br>

	            <h2>2. Visual Design</h2>
	            <p>Working with my idea of a textbook, next I set out to create a visual design that would replicate this imagery and be easily recognizable. For this, I referenced the colours of Post-It notes and their most popular colours as my first design choice. I also had considering making the pages background off white, or weathered, but this made the design feel as though it was a duotang instead of a textbook, in which the pages are often a very crisp shade of white. I knew I wanted to incorporate a custom font that looked like hand-written writing, to add to the feel of this being a textbook with notes written in it. My last consideration was about incorporating page numbers, this felt odd considering the way I grouped the content together (by assignment type and not by the chronological occurrence) would not align with chronological page numbers. I could have done it just by the order I presented them in, but this felt as though a misrepresentation of the assignments and thus I decided against the inclusion of page numbers</p>

	            <figure>
	                <img src="index-process-images/IMG_0997.jpg" width="30%">
	                <img src="index-process-images/IMG_0996.jpg" width="30%">
	                <img src="index-process-images/IMG_1003.PNG" width="30%">
	            </figure>

	            <br>

	            <h2>3. Development</h2>
	            <p>Developing the architecture of the website caused some headaches, as the post-it note style of the navigation bar could be done in many ways. Thus the development of the style relied alot on trial and error of different techniques for creating navigation bars. I tried orginally to create a simple show/hide content with the click of a button, seen in the first photo below, to start. Although, I knew I didnt want to require the user click a button to see all the available content. Before moving past buttons, I did attempt to create a dropdown menu using buttons, seen in the second photo. But much like the first attempt I wanted to move away from the button to reveal contents. This led me to the accordion style that I used in the second project. I was unsure of the sliding interaction that it created at first, but upon further thought it was the easiest way for all the pages' contents to be easily accessible while maintaining the style I wanted for the interface. From here, content was imported into a formatted document, or a new document was created with an iFrame to show content that required alot of it's own styling (the projects for example).</p>
