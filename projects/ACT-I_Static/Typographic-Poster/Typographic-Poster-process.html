            <h2>1. McLuhan Centre Website Audit</h2>
            <p> My first steps in approaching this project included an audit of the existing McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology website. The following are the observations I made in a thorough exploration of the website. <br><br>

            Overall the website is very minimal, containing only important information and copy is edited down to the bare minimum. The site is more image based, using photographs to memorialize and record past events over text descriptions of any conversations. <br>
            Each academic year has a different theme, and thus each event on the page has a slightly different design and layout while still adhering to the set two column style of the page. Considering that each year has it's own theme and stylings, I think that this information would be best separated to allow each theme space to be fully developed without having to compete with other information. Although, with the small amounts of information that each event contains and the understanding that the page acts more as an archive for all past events it still makes sense to combine them all into a singular page. Besides the individual stylings, I think this layout lends itself well to an archival page, but not so well in regard to an upcoming or currently happening event. <br><br>

            specific webpage styling includes the use of line, focusing on strong contrast (white against black, white against red) and repetition of rectangle/square shapes give the page a structural design. The page is structured in two columns, which contain all information regarding past events, dates and themes or concepts discussed. Content is generally formatted as such: <br><br>

            ___________________________________________ Season & Year of event <br><br>

            Seminar Title <br>
            Date of Seminar <br>
            Catchline/summary of event, including guest lecturer(s) names <br>
            Photographs from event <br>

            __________________________________________ <br>

            <h2>2. Poster Reseach and Sitemapping</h2>
            <p>Before attemping to code anything, I wanted to have a design that I found aesthetically pleasing and easily navigatable in mind. Firstly, I scoured the internet to find inspiration for the page design. To do this, I searched for typographic posters in google, taking in the different ways in which people used type to create dynamic and engaging poster designs. In my search I also found that the McLuhan centre had created posters to advertise for their Monday Night Seminars in previous years. These posters actually gave me more direction as to the design I wanted to take on in creating an event page for their 2018/2019 seminars, The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man. <br><br>

            I’ve been focusing on structure, but I think the theme is working to breakdown the structure of the Industrial man. I think this could then be envisioned as a liquifying or pixelating of the man and/or male. With this in mind, it would then make sense that the focus or concept is to look back at the origins of technology and how structures of male ideology are built into systems of technology. Also, how these systems objectify and alienate those outside of cisgender and male 'biological' classifiers. The Pac-man theme used in previous years’ advertising for the event, along with the title ‘Folklore of Industrial Man’ and the connotations of colonialism in many of the seminars leads me to think about video games and the way that these seemingly ‘innocent’ stories often serve to emphasize popular culture and beliefs held within society. I mean, pac-man and pac-woman, reitifies societal understandings of gender as binary, games like Mario are built on the trope of a (male) super-hero saving a damsel in distress. This works to build women as helpless and in need of a strong male figure to save and/or take care of them. Thus I decided to use Nintendo's Gameboy as my source of inspiration for my poster. The naming of technology with gender is a direct reflection of who the device's intended audience was, creating a dynamic that excluded female identifying individuals through language. The gameboy is also an iconic piece of video game history that a lot of people recognize so it makes a good reference point to begin this conversation of the Industrial man, that can include as many people as possible. <br><br>

            To wrap up this section of process, I created a sitemap to decide how I wanted to lay out my webpage for the event, whilst considering the how my page would tie back into the Monday Night Seminars homepage and how to make them atleast somewhat cohesive.</p>

            <h2>3. Visual Design and Development</h2>
            <p> Before finalizing my decision for an idea to move forwards with for this project, I created the above mood board to show to Peter to ask about his thoughts about my concept. I almost changed my decision about the interface and design I wanted to create due to the amount of work each design would take, but upon seeing the two designs side by side and considering the difficulties each presented, I decided to continue with my original idea of re-creating the gameboy face design. The gameboy design did require alot of adjusting in regards to the margins, and some experimentations with different drop down menus, but I think the design is much stronger and aligns well with previous advertising for Monday Night Seminars.</p>
